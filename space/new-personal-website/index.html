                    <p>
                        Hello, this is my website. You can get to know me
                        through this website. These days the website interface
                        design varies greatly, from minimal design to complex
                        design. Because of the large number of website design
                        choices that make me confused to use what kind of style,
                        eventually I decided to go back to 2000s website design.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The appearance of this website is also what I made when
                        I first learned to make a web page using only HTML and
                        also Notepad. But, because this is 2020 and there are
                        lots of tools that make it easy for us to build a modern
                        website, so I decided to build this website using Node,
                        React/Next and Now; so that people don't think that I'm
                        standing by obsolescence.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As I mentioned before, today we are facilitated by
                        modern tools, such as Node, Tailwind, React, Vue,
                        Gatsby, Webpack, and so on. Because of these tools,
                        sometimes someone thinks creating a website today is
                        complicated: because we have to setup "this and that";
                        maybe it's true. On the other hand, I just want to
                        "prove" that making website is easy, "these tools" are
                        literally tools. So, without these tools we can still
                        create a website. Also, when we need these tools, use
                        them. Simple isn't it?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The most important thing is that I am just an ordinary
                        human whose every statement is potentially wrong - just
                        like you.

                            I was born at my grandma's house. Also, grew up
                            there. Programming since high school. Already
                            completed many projects. Sublime Text, Stack
                            Overflow, and DevTools are my beloved friends. I
                            love using the Service Pattern design and BEM
                            methodology. Open source was pleasant; my most
                            favorite projects are <a href="#">OPEN SIMRS</a>. I
                            love blogging, teaching, and cycling.
